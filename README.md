# JAX-For-Deep-Learning | Research Framework from DeepMind

JAX is a Python library designed for high-performance numerical computing, especially machine learning research. Its API for numerical functions is based on NumPy, a collection of functions used in scientific computing. Both Python and NumPy are widely used and familiar, making JAX simple, flexible, and easy to adopt.
